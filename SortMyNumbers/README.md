# Sort My Numbers

Write a program to sort the given numbers in any order (ascending/descending). The given set of numbers have following properties:
1. All are positive integers between range (0 to 65535).
2. There are no duplicates i.e., every number appears maximum once.

Note that using pre-defined alogrithms (insertion sort, bubble sort, binary sort, ...) won't optimize for given conditions. So present a solution that is optimized for both memory and CPU (ideally operate in constant time) for the given conditions.

Expected Output:
1. Code
2. Set of testcases (sample number sets)
