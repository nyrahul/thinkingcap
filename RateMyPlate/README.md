A restaurant keeps a log of `(eater_id, foodmenu_id)` for all the diners. The `eater_id` is a unique number for every diner and `foodmenu_id` is unique for every food item served on the menu.
Write a program that reads this log file and returns the top 3 menu items consumed. If you find a `eater_id` with the same `foodmenu_id` more than once then show an error.

Expected output:
1. Code that can handle the above problem statement
2. Testcases (with example log files) that checks all the possible conditions
